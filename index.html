            <p>Welcome to my Skills Portfolio! By the end of this semester, I hope to showcase my coding growth by demonstrating my improvement throughout each Lab.</p>
            <p>This portfolio is broken down into Labs 1-6. Each lab assigment builds on the last to continuously challenge my skills and show my improvement.</p>

<!-- I chose this introduction because I wanted to clearly explain the basis of the project and how each lab builds on the last  -->

            <!-- TODO: Replace this placeholder content with information about yourself -->
            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> My name is Reese Hansen and I'm am a senior Strategic Communication major with a DCDA minor. I'm from the Bay Area and have loved attending Texas Christian University. After I graduate I plan to continue my time in Texas and move to Dallas.</p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> I'm most interested in writing and digital storytelling. I also enjoy design and exploring new creative outlets. I loved the variety that DCDA gave me within my minor. It allowed me to expand my creativity through different art mediums, while also teaching me relevant coding skills for today's job market.</p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> I hope to gain a better understanding of the general mechanics of how coding works. I also hope to become more comfortable with html and other coding languages.</p>

<!-- This section tells the viewer a bit more about who I am and what I enjoy. It also touches on my career intrests and future plans which involve what the DCDA minor has taught me  -->


<!-- This project properly demonstrates my goals this semester to become more proficient in coding which is explained in my welcome and about section  -->

            <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> [Reflect on the skills you developed across all six labs] I started from Lab 1 with no prior experience with HTML, CSS, or GitHub. Lab 1 challenges my skillset. Throughout this lab I became familiar with the HTML formatting and common coding rules. </p>
            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> [What was difficult? How did you work through it?] I overcame multiple challenges involving problem solving when code didn't translate correctly. Continueing to edit and alter the code to display exactly what I wanted is something I continue to improve on. </p>
            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> [How did your understanding of digital culture and data analytics evolve?]</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> [How will you apply these skills in the future?] In the future, a strong basis of coding knowledge will be very helpful when analyzing data, designing, or creating websites. </p>
