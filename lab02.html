            <h2>Tool 1: Adobe Firefly</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>What the tool does well, where it falls short... Adobe Firefly is an AI image generation tool. it works off of the language within your prompt to create an image. It has to ability to customize your image parameters from widescreen, landscape, square, portrait to vertical. This tool is able to alter images well with only slight changes to its given prompt. It only offers five free images without a subscription. So, if you're trying to achieve exactly what you want asthetically from your image, five tries will likely not be enough. </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Good use cases vs. poor use cases... Adobe Firefly is best for general image generation; however, it's not best for creating specific images since the AI takes creative libertity when creating an image. This tool is well suited for general creative brainstorming. I see Adobe Firefly being useful in campaign or social media post ideas. For example, if you are planning a campign for a company and want to explain your vision better, using AI generated images would be useful to bridge the gap between vision and execution. This tool would be innapripriate to use for a real campign or post because it is poorly executed and clearly AI generated. People may interpret the purpose or content as fake if it's accompanied by clearly AI generated content. This does not replace human judgement because it is based on the prompt put in. Humans are looking for different styles, aesthetics, and messaging behind an image. AI cannot properly asses the "best" image that would ressonate with consumers the most just based on the data given within this platform. Humans are necessary to guide and find problems within the image from a design and customer-focused approach.   </p>
