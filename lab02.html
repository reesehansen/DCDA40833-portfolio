            <h2>Tool 1: Adobe Firefly</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>What the tool does well, where it falls short... Adobe Firefly is an AI image generation tool. it works off of the language within your prompt to create an image. It has to ability to customize your image parameters from widescreen, landscape, square, portrait to vertical. This tool is able to alter images well with only slight changes to its given prompt. It only offers five free images without a subscription. So, if you're trying to achieve exactly what you want asthetically from your image, five tries will likely not be enough. NEED TO ADD </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Adobe Firefly is best for general image generation; however, it's not best for creating specific images since the AI takes creative libertity when creating an image. This tool is well suited for general creative brainstorming. I see Adobe Firefly being useful in campaign or social media post ideas. For example, if you are planning a campign for a company and want to explain your vision better, using AI generated images would be useful to bridge the gap between vision and execution. This tool would be innapripriate to use for a real campign or post because it is poorly executed and clearly AI generated. People may interpret the purpose or content as fake if it's accompanied by clearly AI generated content. This does not replace human judgement because it is based on the prompt put in. Humans are looking for different styles, aesthetics, and messaging behind an image. AI cannot properly asses the "best" image that would ressonate with consumers the most just based on the data given within this platform. Humans are necessary to guide and find problems within the image from a design and customer-focused approach. This does reduce time spent creating or articulating a visual goal. It provides efficiency within the larger workflow. </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Concerns and how they're addressed... Adobe Firefly was trained using existing Adobe platform data. Adobe Stock offers high quality stock images with a large variety of content. From this, Adobe Firefly use existing images as apart of its new AI creations. Adobe Firefly also uses liscened content and public-domain materials in image generation. Adobe's goal with Firefly is to use existing data that has the right to be used commercially, instead of basing content primarily off of unlicensed web content. There are biases within Adobe Firefly. The platform overepresents western aesthetics and design. This is most likely due to the limited stock images used. It lacks a wide range of racial, gender, and cultural diversity when unprompted to do so. Since Adobe Firefily is designed to be commercially safe the risk of copyright infrigement is less compared to other models that use scraped data. The challenges of using AI generated images poses questions about of proper attribution. The correct authorship of artwork goes to Adobe when using this platform. The key to using this platform is transparency about the AI use. Gaps still remain as users may not understand if using content is safe. Bias within the platform is based on the stock images and unclear where it lacks. As AI tools continue to evolve it is the user's responsibility to cite the image source correctly. To properly cite Adobe Firefly you must include "image generated using the prompt "[prompt]" by Adobe, Adobe Firefly,[year](URL)"     </p>

                <figcaption>My goal using Adobe Firefly was to create an advertising campaign for a fake clothing brand. I wanted the brand to be similar to Levi's, using colors like red and blue. I also wanted the AI generated campign to focus on familial values and traditional farm life. This first generated image lacked consumer appeal and storytelling within the campiagn. Adobe Firefly produced the image to the right, which lacked interest but did adequate show denim clothing to promote the fake brand. The citation beaneath includes the prompt written into Adobe Firefly. Citation: "image generated using the prompt "generate a promotional social media post for a clothing brand that sells jeans. use red, blue, denim, and other colors relevant to the brand. include clothing products and make it look aesthetically vintage. include a barn and open green field. add people wearing denim outfits with cowboy hats and cowboy boots. make it have a farm like feel. feel free to add any animals and make it a wide shot photo," by Adobe, Adobe Firefly, 2026 (https://firefly.adobe.com/)   </figcaption>
