            <h2>Critique</h2>
            
            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>The graphic above from Beautiful News, titled “Numerous Countries Are Banning the Use of Wild Animals in Circuses,” displays an evolving and important topic for wildlife conservationists. The graphic displays blue countries that have banned some wild animals in circuses, yellow countries that have banned all wild animal use in circuses, and grey represents local/national bans. The color coding and country names make the map easy to understand at a glance. The graphic uses a world map that comprehensively covers each country but only highlights those with different types of bans on wild animals in circuses. 

            Though it covers a world map, the categories are too broad to fully understand the complex issue of wild animals in circuses. The categories are not explained and do not offer any additional information within the graphic. The phrase “wild animals” is broad, and the graphic does not specify which animals are considered wild in each region. In addition, there are no dates or timelines within the graphic. This makes it harder for the reader to understand the changes within the circus industry over time. It leaves the viewer wondering which bans are relatively new and which happened decades ago. 

            There is also a lack of clarity if the laws against wild animals in circuses are enforced or merely symbolic for the country. The graphic does not explain the consequences or penalties for continuing to use wild animals. Overall, the complexity of the issue is not explained properly within this graphic. The map sufficiently shows where bans are, but each country may have different state or regional laws on the topic. According to Tufte’s perspective, these shortcomings and the simplification of important information lower information resolution. 

            The article, “Victory! India Bans the Use of Wild Animals in Circuses,” by Natasha Brooks, is connected to the graphic. The article includes key details that the graphic leaves out. Brooks describes the animal cruelty, ethics, and public pressure revolving around the ban. She also covers some of the government’s policy motivations. She describes the extreme cruelty and deception of the circus industry, which often intentionally lies about animal conditions. Brooks described the torture that would occur to force the wild animals to perform certain movements. The visualization does not include these extra elements. This lack of content makes the graphic feel incomplete.

            <h3>Effects Without Causes</h3>
            <p>The main problem with this visualization is that it shows effects without causes. It shows what happened, but not why. No additional information is displayed. This information is necessary to understand the social and economic shifts before, during, and after the bans were implemented. No information regarding animal rights activism, cultural changes, or public opinion is a part of the graphic. It does not explain the economic shifts in this entertainment industry as a whole. This unexplained yet present shift made me think not only of circuses, but also zoos and aquariums. Socially, people have continued to protest and fight against captivity and animal cruelty. I believe this fight and debate will continue to grow and change. </p>

            <h3>Overreaching and Cherry-Picking</h3>
            <p>The graphic is also overreaching. The title “Numerous Countries Are Banning the Use of Wild Animals in Circuses” suggests there is a strong global movement. However, the data does not show how many countries still allow wild animals in circuses. It does not correctly compare banned versus non-banned countries. It focuses only on countries that have bans, which could be considered cherry-picking. The data does not show the enforcement or effectiveness of active bans in certain countries. Overall, this data supports a pro-ban narrative without showing the full global picture. 
</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The Beautiful News graphic, “Numerous Countries Are Banning the Use of Wild Animals in Circuses,” works well as an awareness or advocacy graphic but would be considered low-resolution according to Tufte’s standards. The graphic simplifies the issue of wild animal use in circuses greatly. The complexity of the issue is not represented appropriately, as the graphic simplifies the legal realities of each country or region. It also does not display timelines, definitions, or any further details on the issue. There are only outcomes represented with no explanations to follow. To improve this graphic, dates, definitions, regional enforcement information, and causes for the shift to ban would help improve its clarity and completeness. Overall, the graphic is engaging and grabs the reader's attention with a unique design. It is persuasive against the use of wild animals in circuses and is simple enough to quickly understand at a glance. If further information were represented within the graphic, it would be more informative and a better data visualization. </p>
