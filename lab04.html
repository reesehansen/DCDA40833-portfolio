            <h2>Reflection and Analysis</h2>
            
            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
            <p>To upload a proper data set into Tableau, I used the free website Kaggle. Kaggle allowed me to easily download a zip file of my preferred data set, “Video Game Sales,” uploaded by Gregory Smith. The zip file contained a csv file. This cvs file can be accessed, saved to your desktop and uploaded into Tableau through the “text file” tab. I found this to be the easiest way to access a simple csv data set file. Since the set I used came from Kaggle, I did not have to clean up any of the columns before uploading.


            </p>

            <h3>Design Choices</h3>
            <p>When I was creating my visualization, I started by setting the data to present as a bar chart within Tableau. I tested different categories in the row and column sections. As I tested different categories within these, I found that some categories do not present readable data and do not fit any pre-set graph style in Tableau. To create the most readable graph, I used categories like global sales, North American sales, European Union sales, and Japan sales. These quantities are best organized with category and date. I used the year published, the name of games, and game genres to pair with sale quantities. I chose to use line charts to show trends within video game sales from 1980 to 2020. I also chose to use bar charts to compare categories with sales. I chose different colors like blue and pink to flow naturally within my current css styling within my project.

            </p>


            <h3>Expected Patterns</h3>
            <p>Based on my previous knowledge, I expected to see video game sales increase globally from 1980 to 2020. I also expected that Japan would have higher sales earlier than North America and the European Union. Japan’s graphics and video game designs highly influenced the industry as a whole. Other countries took after Japan’s innovation. Sales were lower in the 1980s as video games in general were new and continuously being created. In 1983, you can see a dip in video game sales. This is most likely due to Atari, previously the most popular video game developer, losing its control over the industry. Once it became easy for anyone to create video games, the market became oversaturated with poorly designed games.  
            </p>


            <p>I also expected there to be a rise in sales as video games moved from arcade to mobile devices and at home setups, like the DS and Wii. The visualizations shown above show clear growth from 1980 to about 2010. After 2010, video game sales gradually decreased globally. This may be due to popularity decline and mobile game purchase within a platform and mobile game updates.

            <h3>Surprises</h3>
            <p>I was surprised that “Brain Age” was in the top 20 games purchased globally. I was also surprised that video game sales declined globally as drastically as it did. Wii, including all of the different variations like Wii Sports, Wii Sports Resort, Wii Play, and Wii Fit, dominated the industry. All of the variations mentioned above are a part of the top 20 most sold games. Wii was released in 2006, just four years after, the industry seems to be in a drastic decline. This surprised me since Wii continued to release new versions and make high sales. Based on this information, I would have expected the rise of video game sales to last past 2010. There are not any drastic outliers within my data.

            </p>

            <h3>Questions for Further Investigation </h3>
            <p>Why did sales increase sharply in certain years?</p>
            <p>What new game consoles were released in certain spike years in sales</p>
            <p>What factors influenced sales to drop after 2010?</p>
            <p>In what ways did economic or industry changes affect sales globally?</p>
            <p>Which games caused the biggest spike in sales?</p>
            <p>Which games gave video games the most global popularity?</p>



            <h3>Tool Evaluation</h3>
            <p>I found Tableau to be a great way to create interactive visualizations. It’s easy to swap out different aspects of a data set and create multiple graphs. Tableau also made it easy to compare games, genres, and sales over time. I really enjoyed having interactive features that allow the viewer to see each value within the graph by hoovering over it. This makes the graph clearer and leads to less cluttered explanatory text. </p>

            <p>However, there are limited pre-set graph tools within Tableau. I found it challenging to create a variety of graphs given the simplicity of my data. I also found it challenging to find a data set that had enough variety of information to create clear and interesting visualizations. The platform also requires you to save your work to Tableau Public, which any user can view. </p>
